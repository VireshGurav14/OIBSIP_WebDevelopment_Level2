🔐 User Login Verification Web Module
📌 Project Purpose

To develop a basic user login interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that performs client-side validation and mimics a simple authentication workflow.

🔧 Implementation Steps

Created a structured login form interface using HTML input elements and buttons.

Designed the user interface using CSS to ensure proper alignment, spacing, and a clean visual layout.

Implemented JavaScript-based validation to verify:

Required fields are not left blank

Demo credentials match predefined values

Invalid attempts trigger appropriate error alerts

Tested the login flow in the browser to ensure validation works correctly under different scenarios.

🛠 Technologies & Environment

HTML – Form structure and input elements

CSS – UI design and layout formatting

JavaScript – Input validation and interaction logic

VS Code / Any IDE – Development and editing

Web Browser – Execution and testing

🎯 Final Outcome

Successfully created a login page that performs real-time input validation and simulates basic authentication behavior. This project improved understanding of web forms, validation techniques, and JavaScript DOM interaction.
